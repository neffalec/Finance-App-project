# Financial WebApp Project

## Project Description

This project is my first attempt at a personal full stack development. The idea of a financial planner web application came from my girlfriend who was looking for a good financial app that she could use to help manage her spending, earning, and savings.

### Features

-**Expense Tracker**: A way for the user to input expenses and manage how they are spending.

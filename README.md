# Financial WebApp Project

## Project Description

This project is my first attempt at a personal full stack web app development. The idea of a financial planner web app came from my girlfriend who was looking for a good financial app that she could use to help manage her spending, earning, and savings. While there are many financial planning apps avaiable, most require subscriptions and have standard features that are not customizable to her preferences. In this case, I intend to build an app that is completely free and can be used from any type of device. While having many of the features standard apps have, it will include more personalized features to her preferences, which are listed below in the features section. 

### Features

-**Expense Tracker**: A way for the user to input expenses into the system.

# Financial WebApp Project

## Project Description

This project is my first attempt at a solo full-stack web app development. The idea of a financial planner web app came from my girlfriend who was looking for a good financial app that she could use to help manage her spending, earnings, and savings. While there are many financial planning apps available, most require subscriptions and have standard features that are not customizable to her preferences. In this case, I intend to build a completely free app that can be used from any device. While having many of the features standard apps have, it will include more personalized features to her preferences, which are listed below in the features section. 

### Features

- **Expense Tracker**: The user can input expenses into the system through the expense tracker, identifying what the expense description is, the amount, type of payment, pay date/due date, status, etc. 
- **Budget Planner**: Allows users to create, manage, and monitor budgets for different categories, helping them to stay vigilant in their spending habits.
- **Savings Goals**: Enables the user to set and track savings goals for various objectives, such as vacations, emergency funds, large purchases, and more.
- **Investment Tracking**: Offers a way to monitor user investments, including stocks, bonds, funds, crypto, and more to provide insights into performance and asset allocation.
- **Bill Reminders**: A bill tracking system to send notifications for upcoming bills and subscriptions, reducing the chance of late payments and associated fees.
- **Subscription Management**: Tracks and manages recurring subscriptions, helping users identify all current services. 
- **Financial Reports**: Generates a detailed report on spending patterns, savings, investments, etc. giving a formal overview of the user's financial health. 

### Possible Features

- **Tax Management**: Help the user track tax-deductible expenses and investments, easing the process of tax filing/return.
- **Foreign Currency Support**: Frequent traveling users can conduct transactions in multiple currencies, giving real-time exchange rate information and conversions.
- **Bank Integration**: This would enable direct import of transactions and account balances from various sources, simplifying the tracking process for a user.
- **Custom Alerts**: Allows a user to set custom alerts for specific financial activities, such as large transactions or hitting a budget limit.
- **Credit Score Monitoring**: Allows the user to check their credit scores and receive tips for improvement.
- **Educational Financial Content**: Could give financial resources, such as articles, videos, and tips across many topics.
- **Secure Document Storage**: Offers a secure location to store documents.
  - Would need to look into security and liability.
- **Goal-Based Investment Plans**: Helps the user create and manage investment plans based on specific financial goals, incorporating risk assessment and personalize strategies.
